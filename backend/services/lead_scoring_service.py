"""Lead scoring — how ready a customer is to buy, so a Sale knows who to call first.

Hard signals are scored by deterministic rules, not an LLM. This runs on the path of every
single customer turn (including the ones that never reach the agent pipeline), has to fit
inside a turn already spending two Gemini calls, and must keep working when Gemini is down —
a scoring outage that silently demoted every lead to COLD would hide the queue rather than
degrade it. The LLM is confined to `enrich_with_llm`, which reads the two soft judgements no
regex can make: how urgent the person sounds, and whether they are buying to live in or to
invest.

The hybrid is enforced structurally, not by convention: `SOFT_MAX` sits below
`Settings.lead_warm_threshold`, so a lead with no hard signal at all can never be lifted past
COLD by the model, and can never reach HOT.

Budget detection deliberately goes through `memory_service.extract_facts` rather than reading
a `price` constraint off `SearchCriteria`. The two extractors answer different questions:
`SearchCriteria` records any price the sentence mentions, so "tầm 3.5 tỷ" — a real budget,
phrased the way most Vietnamese buyers phrase it — arrives as `Source.INFERRED` and would be
dropped by an EXPLICIT-only filter, while `memory_service` runs the budget-context /
price-question gate written for exactly this distinction.

To retune the weights, edit `_RULE_WEIGHTS` and bump `ANALYSIS_VERSION`; the signatures do not
change, and rows scored under old weights stay identifiable in the Admin averages.
